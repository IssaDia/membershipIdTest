# membershipIdTest

Your company assigns each customer a membership ID, and you are implementing a check digit for those IDs.

The check digit should be calculated by adding up all digits in each membership ID. If the result of the sum is a number with more than a single digit, another iteration is required, and the digits of the result also should be added together. This process should repeat until a single-digit number is calculated.

For example, for the membership ID "55555" the sum of all digits is 25. Because this is not a single-digit number, 2 and 5 would be added, and the result, 7, would be the check digit.

Solve in the function:

function createCheckDigit(membershipId) {
  // Write the code that goes here.
  return 0;
}

console.log(createCheckDigit("55555"));
